On Reliable Surface Reconstruction from Multiple Range Images This paper addresses the problem of integrating multiple registered 2.5D range images into a single 3D surface model which has topology and geometry consistent with the measurements. Reconstruction of a model of the correct surface topology is the primary goal. Extraction of the correct surface topology is recognised as a fundamental step in building 3D models. Model optimization can then be performed to fit the data to the desired accuracy with an efficient representation. A novel integration algorithm is presented that is based on local reconstruction of surface topology using operations in 3D space. A new continuous implicit surface function is proposed which merges the connectivity information inherent in the individual sampled range images. This enables the construction of a single triangulated model using a standard method. The algorithm is guaranteed to reconstruct the correct topology of surface features larger than the range image sampling resolution. Reconstruction of triangu...
