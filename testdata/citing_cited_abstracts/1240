Text Classification Using WordNet Hypernyms This paper describes experiments in Machine  Learning for text classification using a new  representation of text based on WordNet  hypemyms. Six binary classification tasks of  varying difficulty are defined, and the Ripper  system is used to produce discrimination rules  for each task using the new hypernym density  representation. Rules are also produced with the  commonly used bag-of-words representation,  incorporating no knowledge from WordNet. Experiments show
