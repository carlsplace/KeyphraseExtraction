Extracting Relations from Large Plain-Text Collections Text documents often contain valuable structured data that  is hidden in regular English sentences. This data is best exploited  if available as a relational table that we could use for  answering precise queries or for running data mining tasks.  We explore a technique for extracting such tables from document  collections that requires only a handful of training examples  from users. These examples are used to generate  extraction patterns, that in turn result in new tuples being  extracted from the document collection. We build on this  idea and present our Snowball system. Snowball introduces  novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples  from plain-text documents. At each iteration of the extraction  process, Snowball evaluates the quality of these patterns  and tuples without human intervention, and keeps only the  most reliable ones for the next iteration. In this paper we  also develop a scalable evaluation methodology and metrics  for our task, and present a t...
