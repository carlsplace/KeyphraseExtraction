On Global Warming (Softening Global Constraints) We describe soft versions of the global cardinality constraint  and the regular constraint, with e#cient filtering algorithms maintaining  domain consistency. For both constraints, the softening is achieved by  augmenting the underlying graph. The softened constraints can be used  to extend the meta-constraint framework for over-constrained problems  proposed by Petit, Regin and Bessiere.
