LCC Tools for Question Answering The increased complexity of the TREC QA questions requires advanced text processing  tools that rely on natural language processing and knowledge reasoning. This  paper presents the suite of tools that account for the performance of the PowerAnswer  question answering system. It is shown how questions, answers and world knowledge  are transformed first in logic representation, followed by a systematic and rigorous  logic proof that validly answers questions posed to the QA system. At TREC QA  2002, PowerAnswer obtained a confidence-weighted score of 0.856, answering correctly  415 out of 500 questions.
