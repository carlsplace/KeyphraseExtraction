IRS-II: A Framework and Infrastructure for Semantic Web Services In this paper we describe IRS-II (Internet Reasoning Service) a  framework and implemented infrastructure, whose main goal is to support the  publication, location, composition and execution of heterogeneous web services,  augmented with semantic descriptions of their functionalities. IRS-II has  three main classes of features which distinguish it from other work on semantic  web services. Firstly, it supports one-click publishing of standalone software:  IRS-II automatically creates the appropriate wrappers, given pointers to the  standalone code. Secondly, it explicitly distinguishes between tasks (what to  do) and methods (how to achieve tasks) and as a result supports capabilitydriven   service invocation; flexible mappings between services and problem  specifications; and dynamic, knowledge-based service selection. Finally, IRS-II  services are web service compatible -- standard web services can be trivially  published through the IRS-II and any IRS-II service automatically appears as a  standard web service to other web service infrastructures. In the paper we illustrate  the main functionalities of IRS-II through a scenario involving a distributed  application in the healthcare domain.
