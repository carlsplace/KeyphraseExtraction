Specific Filtering Algorithms for Over-Constrained Problems In recent years, many constraint-specific filtering algorithms have been introduced. Such algorithms use the semantics of the constraint to perform filtering more eciently than a generic algorithm. The usefulness of such methods has been widely proven for solving constraint satisfaction problems. In this paper, we extend this concept to overconstrained problems by associating specific filtering algorithms with constraints that may be violated. We present a paradigm that places no restrictions on the constraint filtering algorithms used. We illustrate our method with a complete study of the All-different constraint.
