Web Caching and Zipf-like Distributions: Evidence and Implications This paper addresses two unresolved issues about web caching. The first issue is whether web requests from a fixed user community are distributed according to Zipf's law [22]. Several early studies have supported this claim [9], [5], while other recent studies have suggested otherwise [16], [2]. The ;econd issue relates to a number of recent studies on the characteristics of web proxy traces, which have shown that the hit-ratios and temporal locality of the traces exhibit certain asymptotic properties that are uniform across the different sets of the traces [43, [XO], [71, [XO], [XS]. In partlc- ular, the question is whether these properties are inherent to web accesses or whether they are simply an artifact of the traces. An answer to these unresolved issues will facili- tate both web cache resource planning and cache hierarchy design
