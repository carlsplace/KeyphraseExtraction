Algorithms for Sequential Decision Making Sequential decision making is a fundamental task faced by any intelligent agent in an extended interaction with its environment; it is the act of answering the question "What should I do now?" In this thesis, I show how to answer this question when "now" is one of a finite set of states, "do" is one of a finite set of actions, "should" is maximize a long-run measure of reward, and "I" is an automated planning or learning system (agent). In particular,
