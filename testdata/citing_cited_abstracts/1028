Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification This document is a revision of the public working draft dated 1998-08-19 incorporating suggestions received in review comments and further deliberations of the W3C RDF Model and Syntax Working Group. With the publication of this draft, the RDF Model and Syntax Specification enters "last call." The last call period will end on October 23, 1998. Comments on this specification may be sent to www-rdf-comments@w3.org. The archive of public comments is available at http://www.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments. Significant changes from the previous draft are highlighted in Appendix E. While we do not anticipate substantial changes, we still caution that further changes are possible. Therefore while we encourage active implementation to test this specification we also recommend that only software that can be easily field-upgraded be implemented to this specification at this time. This is a W3C Working Draft for review by W3C members and other interested parties. Publication as a working draft does not imply endorsement by the W3C membership. The RDF Model and Syntax  Working Group will not allow early implementation to constrain their ability to make changes to this specification prior to final release. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite W3C Working Drafts as other than "work in progress". This work is part of the W3C Metadata Activity.
