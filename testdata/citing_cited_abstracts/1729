Creating Semantic Web Contents with Protege-2000 Because we can process only a tiny fraction of information available on the Web, we must turn to machines for help in processing and analyzing its contents. With current technology, machines cannot understand and interpret the meaning of the information in natural-language form, which is how most Web information is represented today. We need a Semantic Web to express information in a precise, machine-interpretable form, so software agents processing the same set of data share an understanding of what the terms describing the data mean.
