Searching for Planning Operators with Context-Dependent and Probabilistic Effects Providing a complete and accurate domain model  for an agent situated in a complex environmentcan  be an extremely difficult task. Actions mayhave  different effects depending on the context in which  they are taken, and actions mayormay not induce  their intended effects, with the probability of success  again depending on context. We present an algorithm  for automatically learning planning operators  with context-dependent and probabilistic effects in environments  where exogenous events change the state  of the world. Empirical results show that the algorithm  successfully finds operators that capture the  true structure of an agent's interactions with its environment,  and avoids spurious associations between  actions and exogenous events.
