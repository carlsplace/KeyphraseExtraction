CloSpan: Mining Closed Sequential Patterns in Large Datasets Previous sequential pattern mining algorithms mine the full set of frequent subsequences satisfying a rain_sup threshold in a sequence database. However, since a frequent long sequence contains a combinatorial number of frequent subsequences, such mining will generate an explosive number of frequent subsequences for long patterns, which is prohibitively expensive in both time and space.
