Approximate Planning in Large POMDPs via Reusable Trajectories  We consider the problem of choosing a near-best strategy from a restricted class of strategies in a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We assume we are given the ability to simulate the behavior of the POMDP, and we provide methods for generating simulated experience su cient to accurately approximate the expected return of any strategy in the class. We prove upper bounds on the amount of simulated experience our methods must generate in order to achieve such uniform approximation. These bounds have no dependence on the size or complexity of the underlying POMDP, but depend only on the complexity of the restricted strategy class. The main challenge is in generating trajectories in the POMDP that can be reused, in the sense that they simultaneously provide estimates of the return of many strategies in the class. Our measure of strategy class complexity generalizes the classical notion of VC dimension, and our methods develop connections between problems of current interest in reinforcement learning and well-studied issues in the theory of supervised learning. We also discuss a number of practical planning algorithms for POMDPs that arise from our reusable trajectories.
