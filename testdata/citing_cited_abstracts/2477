Overview of the TREC 2001 Question Answering Track The TREC question answering track is an effort to bring the benefits of loxge-scale evaluation to beox  on the question answering problem. In its third yeox, the track continued to focus on retrieving small  snippets of text that contain an answer to a question. However, several new conditions were added to  increase the realism, nd the difficulty, of the task. In the main task, questions were no longer guoxanteed  to have n nswer in the collection; systems returned a response of 'NIL' to indicate their belief that  no nswer was present. In the new list task, systems assembled a set of instances as the response for  a question, requiring the ability to distinguish aong instances found in multiple documents. Another  new task, the context task, required systems to track discourse objects through a series of questions.
