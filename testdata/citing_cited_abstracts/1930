Cost-Aware WWW Proxy Caching Algorithms Web caches can not only reduce network traffic and downloading latency, but can also affect the distribution of web traffic over the network through costaware caching. This paper introduces GreedyDualSize, which incorporates locality with cost and size concerns in a simple and non-parameterized fashion for high performance. Trace-driven simulations show that with the appropriate cost definition, GreedyDual-Size outperforms existing web cache replacement algorithms in many aspects, including hit ratios, latency reduction and network cost reduction. In addition, GreedyDual-Size can potentially improve the performance of main-memory caching of Web documents.
