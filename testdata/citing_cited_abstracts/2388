Goal Tracking in a Natural Language Interface: Towards Achieving Adjustable Autonomy Intelligent mobile robots that interact with humans must  exhibit adjustable autonomy; that is, the ability to  dynamically adjust the level of self-sufficiency of an agent  depending on the situation. When intelligent robots require  close interactions with humans, they will require modes of  communication that enhance the ability for humans to  communicate naturally and that allow greater interaction, as  well as adapt as a team member or sole agent in achieving  various goals. Our previous work examined the use of  multiple modes of communication, specifically natural  language and gestures, to disambiguate the communication  between a human and a robot. In this paper, we propose  using context predicates to keep track of various goals  during human-robot interactions. These context predicates  allow the robot to maintain multiple goals, each with  possibly different levels of required autonomy. They permit  direct human interruption of the robot, while allowing the  robot to smooth...
