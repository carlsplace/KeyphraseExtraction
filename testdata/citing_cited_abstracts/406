First-Order Learning for Web Mining . We present compelling evidence that the World Wide Web is a domain in which applications can benefit from using first-order learning methods, since the graph structure inherent in hypertext naturally lends itself to a relational representation. We demonstrate strong advantages for two applications -- learning classifiers for Web pages, and learning rules to discover relations among pages. 1 Introduction In recent years, there has been a large body of research centered around the topic of learning first-order representations. Although these representations can succinctly represent a much larger class of concepts than propositional representations, to date there have been only a few problem domains in which first-order representations have demonstrated a decided advantage over propositional representations. The graph-like structure provided by pages on the World Wide Web is one domain that seems natural for first-order representation, yet has not been previously studied in this contex...
