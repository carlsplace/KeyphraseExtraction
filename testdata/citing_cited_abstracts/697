Invariant Inference for Static Checking: An Empirical Evaluation Static checking can verify the absence of errors in a program, but often requires written annotations or speci  cations. As a result, static checking can be dicult to use eectively: it can be dicult to determine a speci  cation and tedious to annotate programs. Automated tools that aid the annotation process can decrease the cost of static checking and enable it to be more widely used.
