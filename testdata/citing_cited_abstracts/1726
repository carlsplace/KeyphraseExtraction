Reviewing the Design of DAML+OIL: An Ontology Language for the Semantic Web In the current "Syntactic Web", uninterpreted syntactic constructs  are given meaning only by private off-line agreements  that are inaccessible to computers. In the Semantic Web vision,  this is replaced by a web where both data and its semantic  definition are accessible and manipulable by computer  software. DAML+OIL is an ontology language specifically  designed for this use in the Web; it exploits existing Web  standards (XML and RDF), adding the familiar ontological  primitives of object oriented and frame based systems, and  the formal rigor of a very expressive description logic. The  definition of DAML+OIL is now over a year old, and the language  has been in fairly widespread use. In this paper, we  review DAML+OIL's relation with its key ingredients (XML,  RDF, OIL, DAML-ONT, Description Logics), we discuss the  design decisions and trade-offs that were the basis for the  language definition, and identify a number of implementation  challenges posed by the current language. These issues  are important for designers of other representation languages  for the Semantic Web, be they competitors or successors of  DAML+OIL, such as the language currently under definition  by W3C.
