Efficiently Inducing Features of Conditional Random Fields Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models, a special case of which correspond to conditionally-trained finite state machines. A key advantage of CRFs is their great flexibility to include a wide variety of arbitrary, non-independent features of the input. Faced with
