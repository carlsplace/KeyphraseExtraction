Integrating Exploration, Localization, Navigation and Planning with a Common Representation .  Two major themes of our research include the creation of mobile robot systems that are robust and adaptive in rapidly changing environments, and the view of integration as a basic research issue. Where reasonable, we try to use the same representations to allow different components to work more readily together and to allow better and more natural integration of and communication between these components. In this paper, we describe our most recent work in integrating mobile robot exploration, localization, navigation, and planning through the use of a common representation, evidence grids.  Keywords: mobile robots, localization, planning, navigation, exploration, evidence grids, integration 1. Introduction A central theme of our research is the view of integration as a basic research issue, studying the combination of different, complementary capabilities. One principle that allows integration is the use of unifying representations. Where reasonable, we try to use the same represent...
