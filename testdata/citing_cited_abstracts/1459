Instance-Based Utile Distinctions for Reinforcement Learning with Hidden State We present Utile Suffix Memory, a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses short-term memory to overcome the state aliasing that results from hidden state. By combining the advantages of previous work in instance-based (or "memorybased ") learning and previous work with statistical tests for separating noise from task structure, the method learns quickly, creates only as much memory as needed for the task at hand, and handles noise well. Utile Suffix Memory uses a tree-structured representation, and is related to work on Prediction Suffix Trees [Ron et al., 1994] , Parti-game [Moore, 1993] , G-algorithm [Chapman and Kaelbling, 1991] , and Variable Resolution Dynamic Programming [Moore, 1991] . 1 INTRODUCTION  The sensory systems of embedded agents are inherently limited. When a reinforcement learning agent's sensory limitations hide features of the environment from the agent, we say that the agent suffers from hidden state.  There are many reasons why important features can be hidden...
