PrefixSpan: Mining Sequential Patterns Efficiently by Prefix-Projected Pattern Growth Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. It is challenging since one may need to examine a combinatorially explosive number of possible subsequence patterns. Most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods follow the methodology of    which may substantially reduce the number of combinations to be examined. However,   still encounters problems when a sequence database is large and/or when sequential patterns to be mined are numerous and/or long.
