Precision in Practice: A Type-Preserving Java Compiler Popular mobile code architectures (Java and .NET) include verifiers to check for memory safety and other security properties. Since their formats are relatively high level, supporting a wide range of source language features is awkward. Further compilation and optimization, necessary for efficiency, must be trusted. We describe the design and implementation of a fully type-preserving compiler for Java and ML.
