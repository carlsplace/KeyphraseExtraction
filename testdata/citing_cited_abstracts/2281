Measurement, Modeling, and Analysis of a Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Workload Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing accounts for an astonishing volume of current Internet tra#c. This paper probes deeply into modern P2P file sharing systems and the forces that drive them. By doing so, we seek to increase our understanding of P2P file sharing workloads and their implications for future multimedia workloads. Our research uses a three-tiered approach. First, we analyze a 200-day trace of over 20 terabytes of Kazaa P2P tra#c collected at the University of Washington. Second, we develop a model of multimedia workloads that lets us isolate, vary, and explore the impact of key system parameters. Our model, which we parameterize with statistics from our trace, lets us confirm various hypotheses about file-sharing behavior observed in the trace. Third, we explore the potential impact of localityawareness in Kazaa.
