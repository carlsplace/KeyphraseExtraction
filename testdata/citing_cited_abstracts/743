Scalable Internet Resource Discovery: Research Problems and Approaches Over the past several years, a number of information discovery and access tools have been  introduced in the Internet, including Archie, Gopher, Netfind, and WAIS. These tools have  become quite popular, and are helping to redefine how people think about wide-area network  applications. Yet, they are not well suited to supporting the future information infrastructure,  which will be characterized by enormous data volume, rapid growth in the user base, and  burgeoning data diversity. In this paper we indicate trends in these three dimensions and survey  problems these trends will create for current approaches. We then suggest several promising  directions of future resource discovery research, along with some initial results from projects  carried out by members of the Internet Research Task Force Research Group on Resource  Discovery and Directory Service.
