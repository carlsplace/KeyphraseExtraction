Identifying Topics by Position This paper addresses the problem of identifying  likely topics of texts by their posi-  tion in the text. It describes the automated  training and evaluation of an Optimal Posi-  tion Policy, a method of locating the likely  positions of topic-bearing sentences based  on genre-specific regularities of discourse  structure. This method can be used in  applications such as information retrieval,  routing, and text summarization.
