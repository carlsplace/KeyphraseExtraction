Proof-Carrying Code This paper describes proof-carrying code (PCC), a mechanism by which a host system can determine with certainty thatitissafetoexecute a program supplied (possibly in binary form) by anuntrusted source. For this to be possible, the untrusted code producer must supply with the code a safety proof that attests to the code's adherence to a previously de ned safety policy. The host can then easily and quickly validate the proof without using cryptography and without consulting any external agents. In order to gain preliminary experience with PCC, we have performed several case studies. We showinthis paper how proof-carrying code mightbeusedtodevelop safe assembly-language extensions of ML programs. In the context of this case study, we present and prove the adequacy of concrete representations for the safety policy, the safety proofs, and the proof validation. Finally, we brie y discuss how we use proof-carrying code to develop network packet lters that are faster than similar lters developed using other techniques and are formally guaranteed to be safe with respect to a given operating system safety policy.
