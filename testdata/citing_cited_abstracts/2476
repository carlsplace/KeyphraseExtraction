Mining the Web for Synonyms: PMI-IR Versus LSA on TOEFL This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for recognizing  synonyms, based on statistical data acquired by querying a Web search  engine. The algorithm, called PMI-IR, uses Pointwise Mutual Information  (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of  words. PMI-IR is empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from  the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test questions  from a collection of tests for students of English as a Second Language  (ESL). On both tests, the algorithm obtains a score of 74%. PMI-IR is contrasted  with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves a score of 64% on  the same 80 TOEFL questions. The paper discusses potential applications of the  new unsupervised learning algorithm and some implications of the results for  LSA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).
