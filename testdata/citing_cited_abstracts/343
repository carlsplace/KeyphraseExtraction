Breaking the Barrier of Transactions: Mining Inter-Transaction Association Rules Anthony K. H. Tung Most of the previous studies on mining association rules are on mining intra-transaction associations, i.e., the associations among items within the same transaction, where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer, the events happened on the same day, etc. In this study, we break the barrier of transactions and extend the scope of mining association rules from traditionM intra- transaction associations to inter-transaction associations.
