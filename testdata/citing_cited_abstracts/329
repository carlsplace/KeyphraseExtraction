An Apriori-based Algorithm for Mining Frequent Substructures from Graph Data This paper proposes a novel approach named AGM to efficiently mine the association rules among the frequently appearing substructures in a given graph data set. A graph transaction is represented  by an adjacency matrix, and the frequent patterns appearing in the matrices  are mined through the extended algorithm of the basket analysis. Its performance has been evaluated for the artificial simulation data and  the carcinogenesis data of Oxford University and NTP. Its high efficiency has been confirmed for the size of a real-world problem. . . .
