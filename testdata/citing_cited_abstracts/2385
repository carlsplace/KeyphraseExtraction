Two Ingredients for My Dinner with R2D2: Integration And Adjustable Autonomy While the tone of this paper is informal and tongue-incheek,  we believe we raise two important issues in robotics  and multi-modal interface research; namely, how crucial  integration of multiple modes of communication are for  adjustable autonomy, which in turn is crucial for having  dinner with R2D2. Furthermore, we discuss how our multimodal  interface to autonomous robots addresses these issues  by tracking goals, allowing for both natural and mechanical  modes of input, and how our robotic system adjusts itself to  ensure that goals are achieved, despite interruptions.
