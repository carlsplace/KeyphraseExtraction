Achieving Collaborative Interaction with a Humanoid Robot One of the great challenges of putting humanoid robots  into space is developing cognitive capabilities for the  robots with an interface that allows human astronauts to  collaborate with the robots as naturally and efficiently as  they would with other astronauts. In this joint effort with  NASA and the entire Robonaut team we are integrating  natural language and gesture understanding, spatial  reasoning incorporating such features as human-robot  perspective taking, and cognitive model-based  understanding to achieve this high level of human-robot  interaction.
