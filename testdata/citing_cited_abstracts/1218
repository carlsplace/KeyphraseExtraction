Advances in automatic meeting record creation and access Oral communication is transient but many important decisions, so-cial contracts and fact 'ndings are 'rst canied out in an oral setup, documented in written form and later retrieved. At Carnegie Mel-lons University s Interactive Systems Laboratories we have been experimenting with the documentation of meetings. Ths paper summarizes part of the progress that we have made in this test bed, speci'cally on the question of automatic transcription us-ing LVCSR, information access using non-keyword based meth-ods, summarization and user interfaces. The system is capable to automatically construct a searchable and browsable audiovisual database of meetings and provide access to these records. 1.
